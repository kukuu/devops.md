# DevOps
Transitioning to DevOps requires a change in culture and mindset. At its simplest, DevOps is about removing the barriers between two traditionally siloed teams, development and operations. In some organizations, there may not even be separate development and operations teams; engineers may do both. With DevOps, the two teams work together to optimize both the productivity of developers and the reliability of operations.

They strive to communicate frequently, increase efficiencies, and improve the quality of services they provide to customers. They take full ownership for their services, often beyond where their stated roles or titles have traditionally been scoped by thinking about the end customerâ€™s needs and how they can contribute to solving those needs.

Quality assurance and security teams may also become tightly integrated with these teams. Organizations using a DevOps model, regardless of their organizational structure, have teams that view the entire development and infrastructure lifecycle as part of their responsibilities.

DevOps has gained popularity as organizations seek to achieve faster time-to-market, improved software quality, and increased business agility. By bringing together development and operations teams and implementing automation and collaborative practices, DevOps aims to bridge the gap between software development and IT operations, driving efficiency and innovation in the software delivery process.

The tools, practices and policies DevOps brings along promotes the use of automation, continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipelines, infrastructure as code (IaC), and monitoring tools to streamline processes, eliminate manual tasks, and ensure the smooth flow of software from development to production. It emphasizes the importance of frequent feedback, iterative improvements, and a culture of learning and experimentation.
